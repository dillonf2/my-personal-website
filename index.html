        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website!</h1>
        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My name is Frank Dillon, I am 25 years old, and I em enrolled in the Software Engineering Bootcamp Program at Flatiron School.</li>
            <li>Classes start in roughly one week's time, and I have just recently completed approximately 45 hours worth of pre-requisite assignments and practice.</li>
            <li>Upon completion of this prework, prior to the start of classes, there is a Final Project: to build a website.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Did I Build This Site?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The main reason is, of course, that it is the Final Project of my prework</li>
            <li>In addition to that, I want to gain a fundamental and working understanding of the languages I am attempting to learn</li>
            <li>This seems like the best way to demonstrate to myself what I have learned up to this point, and also push myself to become more comfortable doing these types of tasks. Repitition is King!</li>
